# 🌐 Event & User Management API

A **Django REST Framework (DRF) API** for managing **users and events**.  
Provides **CRUD operations** for user profiles and events, with **authentication via TOKEN**. Supports **image uploads** for event covers.

This API is designed to be used by frontend clients or other services.

---

## ✨ Features

- **User authentication** via TOKEN
- **User profile management** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Event management** with image uploads
- Full **CRUD support** for events
- **Validation** for required fields and types
- Modular design (login, events, image storage)
- RESTful API endpoints using **Django REST Framework**
- Handles **file uploads** (cover images) with automatic URL handling

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This API is designed to:

- Provide a secure backend for user registration and profile management
- Manage events with cover images and metadata
- Serve as a backend for web or mobile applications
- Maintain data integrity via **TOKEN-based authentication**

---

## 🗄️ Data Handling Notes

- User passwords are stored securely and **never returned** in API responses
- `TOKEN` is mandatory for **modifying or deleting** user and event data
- Authentication is token-based and validated per request
- Images are uploaded via a backend module and stored externally
- Uploaded images return a **publicly accessible URL** used in event records
- Input validations include:
  - Type checking (`int` for `phno` and `pincode`)
  - Mandatory field verification
  - Token and username validation for protected routes
- All database and file operations are handled through modular backend services
